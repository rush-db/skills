# RushDB Data Modeling

RushDB uses the **LMPG** (Labels, Multi-Properties, Graph) model — a property-centric graph where every node (record) has a label, a set of typed properties, and can be connected to other records via named relationships.

**Core insight**: you don't define a schema upfront. You push JSON, and RushDB infers structure. Labels and properties emerge from your data. Schema discovery happens via `getSchemaMarkdown`.

## The LMPG Model

| Concept    | RushDB term      | Description                                                     |
| ---------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Node       | **Record**       | A single data entity — like a row, but with flexible properties |
| Node type  | **Label**        | The record's category/type (`USER`, `ORDER`, `PROJECT`)         |
| Attributes | **Properties**   | Key-value pairs with typed values attached to a record          |
| Edge       | **Relationship** | A named, directed connection between two records                |

Records are schema-free: two `USER` records can have different property sets. Properties carry one of four types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `datetime`. A `null` value leaves the field unset — query whether a field is set with `$exists`. Embeddings are `number` arrays with an embedding index for semantic search.

## Labels

### Naming Rules

- **Always UPPER_CASE** — RushDB is case-sensitive. `User` ≠ `USER`. Stick to `USER`.
- Singular noun: `USER` not `USERS`, `ORDER` not `ORDERS`
- No spaces or special characters — use underscores: `BLOG_POST`

### Choosing Labels

Labels should reflect the **entity type**, not the action or state:

| Good        | Avoid                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| `USER`      | `REGISTERED_USER`, `ACTIVE_USER` |
| `ORDER`     | `PLACED_ORDER`, `ORDER_ENTITY`   |
| `BLOG_POST` | `PUBLISHED_CONTENT`, `POST_NODE` |

Use a single label per record type. Model state with a `status` property, not separate labels.

### Multi-Label Queries

`findRecords` with `labels: ["ARTICLE", "BLOG_POST"]` returns both types (OR). Useful for shared abstract types (e.g., all content records).

## Properties

### Supported Types

| Type       | Example values           | Notes                                                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `string`   | `"hello"`, `"active"`    | Case-sensitive equality; case-insensitive for `$contains` etc. |
| `number`   | `42`, `3.14`, `-100`     | Supports full range operators                                  |
| `boolean`  | `true`, `false`          |                                                                |
| `datetime` | `"2026-04-10T09:00:00Z"` | ISO 8601 UTC format. Use component objects for range queries.  |

> Writing `null` (or an all-`null` array) leaves the field **unset** — it is not stored and does not appear in the schema. Match set/unset fields with `{ field: { $exists: true } }` / `{ field: { $exists: false } }`.

### Naming Conventions

- **camelCase** for all property names: `createdAt`, `isActive`, `userId`
- Consistent types per property across all records of the same label
- Avoid reusing a property name with different types across records of the same label
- ISO 8601 for all timestamps: `"2026-04-10T09:00:00Z"` (always UTC)
- Booleans as `isX` or `hasX`: `isActive`, `hasAccess`, `isPremium`

### Property Discovery

```
getSchemaMarkdown()         → all labels + all properties + value ranges
findProperties({ labels: ["USER"] })  → detailed property list for a label
getSchema()                 → same as above but structured JSON with propertyId values
propertyValues(propertyId)    → distinct values / min-max for a property
```

## Relationships

### How Auto-Linking Works

When you pass nested objects to `bulkCreateRecords`, RushDB creates:

- One record per nested label key
- One relationship per parent→child nesting level
- Relationship type defaults to the uppercase label name

Example — this single import:

```json
{
  "label": "COMPANY",
  "data": {
    "name": "Acme Corp",
    "DEPARTMENT": [
      {
        "name": "Engineering",
        "EMPLOYEE": [
          { "name": "Alice", "role": "Engineer" },
          { "name": "Bob", "role": "Manager" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Produces:

- 1 `COMPANY` record
- 1 `DEPARTMENT` record → linked to COMPANY
- 2 `EMPLOYEE` records → each linked to DEPARTMENT
- Relationships: `COMPANY -[HAS_DEPARTMENT]→ DEPARTMENT`, `DEPARTMENT -[HAS_EMPLOYEE]→ EMPLOYEE`

No schema declaration. No migration. Just push the JSON.

### Manual Relationship Management

```
attachRelation({ sourceId, targetId, type: "AUTHORED" })
detachRelation({ sourceId, targetId, type: "AUTHORED" })
findRelationships({ source: { where: { $id: "record-id" } } })
findRelationships({ target: { where: { $id: "record-id" } } })
```

### Relationship Naming Conventions

- **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE**: `AUTHORED_BY`, `BELONGS_TO`, `DEPENDS_ON`, `HAS_TASK`
- Directional and readable: `AUTHOR -[WROTE]→ POST`, `SESSION -[HAS_DECISION]→ DECISION`
- Verb-based: describes the action/association from source to target

### Relationship Query Patterns

Relationships are traversed in `where` by using the target label as the key:

```json
{
  "labels": ["COMPANY"],
  "where": {
    "DEPARTMENT": {
      "name": "Engineering",
      "$relation": { "type": "HAS_DEPARTMENT", "direction": "out" }
    }
  }
}
```

Omit `$relation` when direction and type are not important — RushDB traverses any edge.

## Data Import Patterns

### Flat Records (simple entities)

Use `createRecord` for individual records with no nesting:

```json
{
  "label": "PRODUCT",
  "data": {
    "name": "Widget Pro",
    "sku": "WGT-PRO-001",
    "price": 49.99,
    "category": "hardware",
    "inStock": true,
    "createdAt": "2026-04-10T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Hierarchical Data (nested structures)

Use `bulkCreateRecords` with nested label keys for structures like org charts, project trees, or content hierarchies. The nesting depth can be arbitrary.

### CSV / Flat Files

Use `exportRecords` to export existing records to CSV. For import, use `bulkCreateRecords` by transforming flat rows into records with a consistent label.

When source rows have blank cells, pass `options: { skipEmptyValues: true }` so empty strings (`""`) and empty arrays (`[]`) are treated as unset (no property is created) instead of being stored as empty values. `0` and `false` are real values and are always kept. Defaults to `false`.

### Enum Fields

Define a consistent set of values upfront and document them as a `status` or `type` field comment. Enforce consistency via `propertyValues` queries during writes if needed.

## Schema Discovery Workflow

When working with an existing database:

1. **`getSchemaMarkdown()`** — see all labels, their property names/types, and relationships
2. **`findProperties({ labels: ["LABEL"] })`** — deep-dive a specific label
3. **`propertyValues(propertyId)`** — enumerate distinct string/boolean values or get number/date ranges
4. **`findRelationships({ source: { where: { $id: "sample-id" } } })`** and **`findRelationships({ target: { where: { $id: "sample-id" } } })`** — explore outgoing and incoming connections from a sample record

Never guess label names or property names — always discover them first.

---

## Schema Evolution Patterns

### Add a property

Just include it in new records. Existing records that lack it are unmatched by filters on that field — they're not broken.

### Change a property name

1. `findRecords` to get all affected records
2. `updateRecord` each with the new property name added and old removed
3. There is no schema migration — just update the data

### Add a label

Start creating records with the new label — it appears in `getSchemaMarkdown` once at least one record exists.

### Retire a label

1. Add `deprecated: true` to all existing records of that label
2. Stop creating new ones
3. Filter with `{ deprecated: { $ne: true } }` in queries until fully cleaned up
4. Delete with `bulkDeleteRecords` (always preview first)

### Split a label into two

1. `findRecords` on old label, classify each record by new label
2. `bulkCreateRecords` into new labels
3. Re-attach relationships with `attachRelation`
4. Mark old records as deprecated

## Common Modeling Mistakes

| Mistake                                   | Correct approach                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Label as lowercase: `user`, `order`       | Always UPPER_CASE: `USER`, `ORDER`                                       |
| Storing state in the label: `ACTIVE_USER` | Store state as `status: "active"` on `USER`                              |
| One giant label with all fields           | Split into focused labels linked by relationships                        |
| Guessing property names                   | Call `getSchemaMarkdown` or `findProperties` first                       |
| Hardcoding enum values                    | Probe with `propertyValues` before filtering                             |
| Plain date strings in range queries       | Use component objects: `{ $gte: { $year: 2024 } }`                       |
| Inventing `$label`/`$direction` operators | Use the label as the key, `$alias` for naming, `$relation` for edge type |
